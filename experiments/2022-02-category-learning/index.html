            This experiment is part of a research project conducted
            by the <a href="http://cpilab.org/" target="_blank">Computational Principles of Intelligence Group</a>
            at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tuebingen, Germany.<br><br>

            Your data will be anonymized and only used in the manner described in our data protection sheet,
            available <a href="https://kyblab.tuebingen.mpg.de/compositionalbandits/data_protection.pdf"
                target="_blank">here</a>
            (please do not fill out this sheet!).

The processing and use of the collected data occurs in a pseudoanonymized form within the scope of the legally prescribed provisions.
As a general rule, the storage occurs in the form of answered questionnaires, as well as electronic data, for a duration of 10 years or longer, if this is required by the purpose of the study.

By providing of further personal data in pseudoanonymized form, collected personal data may be used for the preparation of anonymized
scientific research work and may also be published and used in an anonymized form in medical journals and scientific publications, so that a direct assignment to my person cannot be established.

The information obtained during the course of this study may also be sent in an anonymized form to cooperation partners within the scope of
the European General Data Protection Regulation for scientific purposes and to cooperation partners outside of the European Union, i.e. to countries with a lower data protection level (this also applies to the USA).

The data collected within the scope of the study can also be used and processed in the future inside of the Max Planck Institute.

I was informed about my rights, that at any time:

I can withdraw this declaration of consent.

I can request information about my stored data and request the correction or blocking of data.

By cancellation of my participation in the study,
I can request that any personal data of mine collected until that point are immediately deleted or anonymized.

I can request that my personal data are handed out to me or to third parties (if technically feasible).

I herewith declare that:

I have been adequately informed about the collection and processing of my personal data and rights.

I consent to the collection and processing of personal data within the scope of the study and its pseudoanonymized disclosure,
so that only the persons conducting the study can establish a link between the data and my person.

Agreement:

I agree to participate in this experiment.

I consent to the use of my data described in the Data Protection Information Sheet
and confirm having received a copy of the Data Protection Sheet.

I consent to data transfer from the MPI for Biological Cybernetics encrypted database to the project-related collaborators:
inside of the Max Planck Society and affiliated research institutes, or at partnering institutions like the University of Tuebingen.

        Today, you find yourself in <b>Monster World</b>.<br>
        In Monster World, you are introduced to a new species of friendly monsters.
        All monsters differ from each other. However, the way they differ can be described in two dimensions:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>The spikiness of their head differs from not spiky to very spiky.</li>
            <li>The size of their belly varies from empty to full</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>
            Your session today will be split up into three parts.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Memory:</b> Remember the spikiness of the monster's head and
                the fill of the monster's belly. You are only presented
                with a monster only for a short period of time on every trial.
                After that, you are required to adjust two sliders to reconstruct
                the head and the belly of the monster.
                <b>Takes approx. 20 min</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Categorization:</b> The monsters all look somewhat similar, but they
                come from different tribes. Use the information about the
                spikiness of their head and the fill of their belly to
                gauge what tribes they are from.
                You are going to get a feedback after every trial, which may
                help getting you started. <b>Takes approx. 50 min</b>.
                There will be breaks in between these 50 mins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Memory:</b> The third part will be the same as the first part. Try to remember
                the monsters presented on every trial. <b>Takes approx. 20 min</b>
            </li>

            The numbers correspond to the respective category:
